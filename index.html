            ['<h1>Hole 1</h1> <p>Hole 1 is a short hole. It is a dog-leg to the right par 4. The green is on an uphill slope and is normally reachable with a wedge.</p>', 44.543221, -78.087168, 1],
            ['<h1>Hole 2</h1> <p>Hole 2 is one of the straightest holes at Wildfire. With two challenging fairway bunkers on the left hand side and an uphill and sloped green, this par 4 is not as easy as it looks.</p>', 44.545450, -78.084729, 2],
            ['<h1>Hole 3</h1> <p>Hole 3 is the shortest par 3 on the golf course. It may appear very simple, however the 5 bunkers surrounding the green can quickly change your score from a par to a double and leave you frustrated walking to the fourth tee.</p>', 44.545866, -78.083415, 3],
            ['<h1>Hole 4</h1> <p>This hole is short par 5 and reachable in 2 for some golfers. However, the green is very small and missing the fairway can be crucial due to trees, bunkers and fescue.</p>', 44.545093 , -78.079892, 4],
            ['<h1>Hole 5</h1> <p>This is the second par 5 in a row on the front nine. This dog-leg par 5 is surrounded by forests that are known to swallow golf balls</p>', 44.546400, -78.082123, 5],
            ['<h1>Hole 6</h1> <p>The first of three par 4s in a row, this is a difficult dog-leg to the left with a lopsided green. The fairway is easy to hit, but the green is easier to miss</p>', 44.547519, -78.081920, 6],
            ['<h1>Hole 7</h1> <p>The hardest hole on the golf course. This long and rocky par 4 is a nightmare to the average golfer. Although, it is one of the prettiest holes and great for photos from the tee.</p>', 44.548196, -78.083658, 7],
            ['<h1>Hole 8</h1> <p>The last of the par 4 stretch. Number 8 green can not be seen from the tee and is a normally difficult par 4 if you miss the fairway</p>', 44.545630, -78.085861, 8],
            ['<h1>Hole 9</h1> <p>Hole 9 is the longest par 3 on the course. The tee sits high above the green and is often affected by the wind. A par on this hole should make a golfer very content to end the front nine</p>', 44.543906, -78.087831, 9],
            ['<h1>Hole 10</h1> <p>Number 10 has a large very fairway. For a par 4 this hole is rather easy as long as you do not miss right into the large Stony Lake shaped bunker.</p>', 44.545924, -78.089121, 10],
            ['<h1>Hole 11</h1> <p>The third par 3 of the course. With another green below the tee, this hole is much easier than 9 as it is protected from the wind by trees all around.</p>', 44.548056, -78.086828, 11],
            ['<h1>Hole 12</h1> <p>The most beautiful hole on the golf course. Golfers will have to clear the water twice, and once onto a semi-island green. Be sure to capture a photo from the tee.</p>', 44.550047, -78.090375, 12],
            ['<h1>Hole 13</h1> <p>The last trecherous par 4 on the golf course. Protected by forests on both sides, this hole may cause some problems starting at the tee.</p>', 44.550826, -78.090142, 13],
            ['<h1>Hole 14</h1> <p>Can be the easiest par 4 on the golf course, can also be very difficult as the green is easy to miss. It can even be reachable from the tee under prime conditions.</p>', 44.551719, -78.090644, 14],
            ['<h1>Hole 15</h1> <p>Another par 3. Number 15 must be hit over a swamp in order to reach the green that is not easily viewable. Sometimes, only the flag pin is visible from the back decks.</p>', 44.551400, -78.093062, 15],
            ['<h1>Hole 16</h1> <p>A long par 5. With a large fairway and forests/swamps to both sides, this hole is hard to mess up on your first shot - however, careful with your second shot as there are bunkers over the hill that can be a bit of a surprise.</p>', 44.548605, -78.093313, 16],
            ['<h1>Hole 17</h1> <p>A short downhill par 3. Other than the front left bunker beside the green - most golfers should not come into many problems here.</p>', 44.548170, -78.090268, 17],
            ['<h1>Hole 18</h1> <p>The make it or break it hole. You will either birdie or bogey this hole. The dog-leg left par 5 has a beautiful view of the outstanding clubhouse. It also includes a large pond to the right of the fairway and the green - which makes it easier for lefties.</p>', 44.545877, -78.090429, 18],
            ['<h1>Clubhouse</h1> <p>Come in and enjoy a nice meal either indoors or outdoors. Make sure to visit the guys in the pro shop and sign up for mens day or ladies day!</p>', 44.543540, -78.090053, 19],
            ['<h1>Driving Range</h1> <p>Up to 280 yards of driving range and numerous greens to target. Also includes a chipping green/bunker and a connected putting green</p>', 44.545640, -78.087443, 20]
